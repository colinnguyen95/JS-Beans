# Welcome to our Team Project - JS Beans

The website is live at this url: [JS Beans Website](https://kind-mcclintock-02b66c.netlify.com/)

Key Things:

1. Users can sign up, login, and logout through the Firebase Database. When a user clicks on "Login" in the navbar, a modal will appear. 
2. jQuery is used on the home page to enable smooth scrolling to the Courses section when users click on "Start Learning" button or "Courses" in the nav bar
3. The overall site was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
4. Content is stored in json files (for now) 
5. Every subject card is not created manually. The program fetces content stored in json files and runs an array method to create each subject card dynamically.
6. The site is mobile friendly, resize the window and observe how the layout of the cards adapt to various screen sizes. This was done using CSS Grids and media queries.



Here is a screenshot of the homepage:
