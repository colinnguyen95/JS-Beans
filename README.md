# Welcome to our Team Project - JS Beans

The website is live at this url: [JS Beans Website](https://kind-mcclintock-02b66c.netlify.com/)

Key Things:

1. Users can sign up, login, and logout through the Firebase Database. When a user clicks on "Login" in the navbar, a modal will appear. 
2. jQuery is used on the home page to enable smooth scrolling to the Courses section when users click on "Start Learning" button or "Courses" in the nav bar
3. The overall site was built using vanilla JavaScript aside from the scroll bar
⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)
